Built a Todo List web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to implement core CRUD operations. The application enables users to add, view, edit, and delete tasks through a user-friendly interface, with the added functionality of setting task deadlines for effective time management and tracking.
Below is the screenshot of how the app looks.
